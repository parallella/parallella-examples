Compile and run as root ($ sudo -i)

Uses default definitions found in the top of the Makefile

$ make
$ ./main.x

NOTES:

One must take care to balance the work across cores with
appropriate values for the following command line args.

COMMAND LINE:

-n [on-chip number of particles]
	This is the on-chip matrix size, typically up to 4096
	for Epiphany III or up to 16384 for Epiphany IV.
	Exceeding approximately 256 particles per core results
	in undefined behavior.

-s [off-chip scale factor]
	This value is the amount of off-chip blocks to use.
	Setting -n 4096 and -s 2, will perform a 8192 particle
	calculation.  Use -s 1 (default) for a fully on-chip
	calculation.

-i [number of time step iterations]
	This value is the outer loop of the calculation, or the
	number of time steps for particle position updates.

-d [eCore dimension]
	This is the dimension of the 1D eCore array (typically
	16 for Epiphany III or 64 for Epiphany IV).  You may use
	less than the number of cores available but the behavior
	is undefined when using more.

-t [timestep value]
	This sets the timestep value. 1.0 for fast, 0.1 for slow,
	or any value in-between for your speed preference.

-r
	This causes the simulation to reset with random star positions
	after every run completes, and starts over

--validate

-h, --help
	Lists help for commands

Example uses:

./main.x
	Uses default definitions found in the top of the Makefile

./main.x -n 4096 -s 1 -i 100 -d 16
	Performs a 4096 particle calculation with each of the 16
	eCores getting a 256 particle working set.

./main.x -n 4096 -s 2 -i 100 -d 16
	Performs a 8192 particle calculation with each of the 16
	eCores getting a 256 particle working set.

./main.x -n 256 -s 16 -i 100 -d 1 --validate
	Performs a 4096 particle calculation with a single eCore
	and validates the result with the ARM CPU host.
